      Controller bot opens new ways for monetization of your channels!
      
      We see that authors of the unique content more often seek ways to spread it via private Telegram channels which are channels with a paid subscription. And we can feel their "pain" caused by the daily actualization of the list of subscribers who paid for the subscription.
      
      Manual moderation is in the past now - try a new feature of paid subscriptions offered by @ControllerBot!
      
      *Just do 3 simple steps:*
      1. Activate the feature on your private channel
      2. Following detailed instructions set up a butler bot that will deal with potential subscribers and offer them your tariffs
      3. Send the butler bot link to your audience
      
      *And we'll take care of the rest:*
      1. Receiving payments for the subscription
      2. Adding paid subscribers to the channel
      3. Notifying about the close date of the subscription expiration
      4. Deleting users who haven't renewed the subscription
    first_link_text: |
      Tariffs have been created, and the channel set-up is completed \- it's time to start attracting the audience! 
      
      *It's possible to buy a subscription for your channel* [follow the link](${link})
      
      _A tip: If you have several different sources of traffic, you can create additional links and monitor their statistics separately. It can help you understand which of the sources works better_
    list_balances: |
      *ATTENTION!* In some cases, withdrawal is possible only after 24 hours from the moment of enrollment!
      We charge ~10% commission on every deposit.
